# ASCII Art Generator with Color Output

This project is a simple Python script that generates ASCII art from user input and displays it in blue color using `pyfiglet` and `colorama`. Additionally, it saves the generated ASCII art to a text file for easy sharing or future reference.

## Features
- **User Input**: Prompts the user to enter text to be converted into ASCII art.
- **Color Display**: Uses `colorama` to display the ASCII art in blue color in the terminal.
- **File Output**: Saves the ASCII art to a file named `ascii_art_output.txt` in the current directory.

## Requirements
- **Python 3**: Ensure that Python is installed on your system.
- **Dependencies**:
  - [`pyfiglet`](https://pypi.org/project/pyfiglet/) for ASCII art generation
  - [`colorama`](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/) for color output in the terminal

### Installation
To install the required dependencies, run:
```bash
pip install pyfiglet colorama
